STEM Learning Assistant RAG Project - Complete Implementation Plan
Perfect! Let's create a comprehensive 4-week plan that will help you build an impressive RAG project using your Python skills while meeting all of Evobi's technical requirements.

Project Timeline: 4 Weeks
Week 1: Foundation & Setup
Days 1-2: Environment Setup

Install Python 3.9+, create virtual environment

Set up GitHub repository with proper structure

Install core dependencies: torch, transformers, sentence-transformers, langchain, fastapi, neo4j, google-generativeai

Get Gemini API key from Google AI Studio

Install Neo4j Desktop and create your first database

Days 3-5: Data Collection & Basic RAG

Collect STEM educational content (Arduino guides, robotics basics, Python tutorials)

Create simple document chunking system

Implement basic embedding generation using Sentence Transformers

Build minimal vector similarity search with FAISS

Days 6-7: First Prototype

Create basic FastAPI endpoint for question answering
