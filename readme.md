# STEM Learning Assistant — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

An STEM educational assistant that answers questions on robotics, electronics, and programming by retrieving relevant context from documents and knowledge graphs, then generating answers using Google’s Gemini API.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines vector similarity search (using Sentence Transformers + FAISS) and structured knowledge retrieval from a Neo4j knowledge graph.
- **Contextualized Responses:** Uses Gemini API (Google Generative AI) to generate detailed, accurate answers grounded in retrieved STEM educational content.
- **Smart Document Processing:** Cleans and splits raw educational text documents into contextually coherent chunks.
- **Concept Linking:** Extracts STEM concepts from text and connects them via relationships in Neo4j for semantic graph traversal.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Provides a REST API with endpoints to answer questions and supports a simple web interface.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Uses Python and widely supported libraries, suitable for learning and extension.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Sentence Transformers** for embedding generation  
- **FAISS** for efficient vector similarity search  
- **Neo4j** for knowledge graph storage and querying  
- **Google Gemini API** as the large language model  
- **FastAPI** for backend API and static file serving

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
git clone <repo-url>
cd stem-learning-assistant



2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows


3. **Install dependencies**  
pip install -r requirements.txt



4. **Set up environment variables**  
Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password



5. **Prepare raw documents**  
Place your STEM educational `.txt` files inside `data/raw_documents/`.

6. **Start Neo4j database**  
Make sure Neo4j Desktop or your Neo4j instance is running.

7. **Populate the knowledge graph**  
python scripts/populate_neo4j.py



8. **Run the FastAPI server**  
python src/api/main.py

## Usage

- Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)  
- Enter your STEM question in the text box and click **Ask**  
- View the generated answer along with context information

**Or** use the `/ask` POST API endpoint directly:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d '{"question":"How to blink an LED with Arduino?"}'

## Sample STEM Document Formatting Guide

To maximize retrieval performance and concept extraction, your STEM `.txt` documents should:

- Use **clear headings and sections**, e.g.:
Arduino Basics
What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform...

Programming Structure
Every Arduino sketch has two main functions:...



- Write **concise paragraphs** with relevant, factual information.
- Include **important keywords** such as "Arduino", "LED", "Ohm's Law", "Sensor" throughout the text to facilitate concept linking.
- Avoid overly technical jargon without explanation to help the system generate student-friendly answers.
- Use **consistent punctuation and formatting** (avoid long unbroken text blocks).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Neo4j Connection Issues

- Confirm Neo4j service is running locally or remotely.
- Verify `.env` file credentials exactly match your Neo4j user and password.
- Test connection using Neo4j Desktop or [Neo4j Browser](http://localhost:7474).
- For remote DB, check firewall and IP whitelist settings.

### Gemini API Errors

- Ensure your API key is valid and has active quota.
- Double-check `.env` has the correct `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- If rate limited, try with a new key or wait for quotas to reset.
- Review Google AI Studio documentation or error logs sent by API responses.

### Python Dependency Issues

- Verify Python version is 3.9 or newer.
- Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install exact versions.
- If errors persist, update pip or reinstall problematic packages individually.

### FAISS Index Fails or Returns Empty

- Check that embeddings are generated by running embedder encode test script.
- Confirm FAISS index is built before searching.
- Use logging to verify embeddings shape matches chunk count.
- Restart app to clear cache and rebuild index if corrupted.
