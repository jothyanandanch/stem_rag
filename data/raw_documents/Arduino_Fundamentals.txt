# Arduino Fundamentals and Programming Guide

## What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a programmable circuit board (microcontroller) and a development environment for writing code. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, or publishing something online.

## Arduino Board Components
The Arduino Uno, the most popular model, contains several key components:

**Microcontroller:** The ATmega328P is the brain of the Arduino Uno. It executes the code you write and controls all the inputs and outputs.

**Power Supply:** Arduino can be powered through USB connection or external power supply (7-12V recommended). The board has built-in voltage regulators to provide 5V and 3.3V to components.

**Digital Pins:** Arduino Uno has 14 digital input/output pins (pins 0-13). These can be configured as either inputs to read sensors or outputs to control actuators like LEDs or motors. Some pins have special functions like PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) indicated by ~ symbol.

**Analog Pins:** Six analog input pins (A0-A5) can read analog sensors like temperature sensors, light sensors, or potentiometers. These pins can read values from 0-1023 representing voltages from 0-5V.

**USB Interface:** Used for programming the board and serial communication with your computer. It also provides power when connected to USB.

## Basic Programming Structure
Every Arduino sketch (program) has two main functions:

**setup() function:** Runs once when the program starts. Used for initializing variables, pin modes, and starting libraries.

**loop() function:** Runs continuously after setup(). This is where the main program logic goes.

void setup() {
// Initialization code he
e pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as ou
void loop() {
// Main program code he
e digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn on
LED delay(1000); // Wait 1
econd digitalWrite(13, LOW); // Turn
off LED delay(1000); // Wai


## Common Programming Functions
**pinMode(pin, mode):** Configures a pin as INPUT or OUTPUT.

**digitalWrite(pin, value):** Sets a digital pin HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V).

**digitalRead(pin):** Reads the value from a digital pin, returns HIGH or LOW.

**analogRead(pin):** Reads analog input (0-1023) from analog pins.

**analogWrite(pin, value):** Outputs PWM signal (0-255) on PWM-capable pins.

**delay(milliseconds):** Pauses program execution for specified time.

**Serial.begin(baudrate):** Initializes serial communication for debugging.

**Serial.print(data):** Sends data to serial monitor for debugging.

## Project Example: Temperature Monitoring System
This project demonstrates reading analog sensors and serial communication:

Components needed: Arduino Uno, TMP36 temperature sensor, breadboard, jumper wires.

Circuit: Connect TMP36 sensor's power pin to 5V, ground to GND, and signal pin to A0.

The TMP36 outputs 10mV per degree Celsius with 500mV offset at 0Â°C. To convert the analog reading to temperature: Temperature = (analogReading * 5.0 / 1024.0 - 0.5) * 100.

## Arduino Libraries and Ecosystem
Arduino has thousands of libraries that extend functionality:

**Servo Library:** Controls servo motors with precise positioning.

**SoftwareSerial:** Creates additional serial ports on digital pins.

**Wire Library:** Enables I2C communication with sensors and displays.

**SPI Library:** Serial Peripheral Interface communication.

**WiFi Libraries:** Enable wireless connectivity on ESP32/ESP8266 boards.

The Arduino IDE includes a Library Manager where you can easily install libraries for specific sensors, displays, or communication protocols.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
**Upload Errors:** Check correct board and port selection in Arduino IDE. Ensure no other programs are using the serial port.

**Code Not Working:** Use Serial.print() to debug variable values. Check wiring connections and component orientations.

**Power Issues:** Verify power supply voltage and current ratings. Check for short circuits.

**Sensor Readings Unstable:** Add pull-up resistors for digital inputs. Use capacitors to filter analog signals.
